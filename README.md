# üíª Middle School IT Club Website

This repository contains the source code for a website built for the **IT club at a middle school (16 years old)**.

The site was designed to be a central online space, providing **information about the club's activities** and sharing **news and updates** with students.

## ‚ú® Project Context: Going Beyond the Basics

This project was undertaken as a practical exercise to learn and apply modern web development concepts.

**Crucially, building this site represented a significant leap beyond the foundational HTML and CSS taught in our regular IT lessons.** It was an ambitious personal project to explore modern front-end frameworks and development workflows that were entirely new to me at the time.

Specifically, this project focused on:

*   Building a static website with **Gatsby.js** for performance and structure.
*   Integrating a **Headless CMS (GraphCMS/Hygraph)** for managing content easily.
*   Implementing styling using **Styled Components**.
*   Experimenting with **Continuous Integration (CircleCI)** for automated builds and deployments (though this setup might also require updates).
*   Website has versions for Mobile and Desktop

It represents an early, ambitious stage of my development journey, pushing the boundaries of what I was learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Gatsby.js:** The React-based framework for building the static site.
*   **GraphCMS (now Hygraph):** Used as the content management system.
*   **Styled Components:** For component-scoped styling.
*   **CircleCI:** Used for Continuous Integration/Deployment setup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Project Status

Please be aware that this project was developed some time ago and **utilizes older versions of its dependencies** (Gatsby framework, various libraries, etc.).

As a result, running it in its current state directly **will likely require troubleshooting and resolving dependency conflicts** due to outdated libraries.

While not immediately runnable without significant updates, it serves as a **historical example of my learning journey** with these technologies and demonstrates the project's original structure, concepts, and intended functionality.
